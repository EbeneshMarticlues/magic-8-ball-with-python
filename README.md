# magic-8-ball-with-python
This program starts by defining a list of possible answers, and then enters a loop that prompts the user to ask a question. If the user types "quit", the loop breaks and the program ends. Otherwise, the program chooses a random answer from the list of possible answers and prints it to the console.
